# Slider 

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to practicing JavaScript.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

-	JavaScript basics
	-	DOM events
    -   DOM event listener
    -   `offsetWidth` property
    -   JavaScript timing events
    -   Arrow functions
    - `forEach()` method
